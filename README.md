# LaserFreeTarget
This is my initial start on making an open source 10m air laser target which would allow people to train with a low cost solution which reduces the consumables associated with electronic targets

# Maths and Assumptions
Pellet diameter: 4.5mm
Pellet length: 5.56mm
Pellet Speed: 150mm/s
Time in Beam: 37ms

37/8 = 4.625ms
